# Problem Statement:
> A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction

# Business Goal:
> Build a Logistic Regression model to predict which and all customers are going to churn, and which customers needed to focus more to regain our business.
